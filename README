This is an extension of PHPExcel that will allow you to do a lookup of 
values in your Excel file and return results based on those values.  Once
search completes, a new Excel file is downloaded onto the client's computer
with the added info.

Directions:
1. Upload the classes.php and search.php files into your PHPExcel root directory
2. Edit the search.php to fit customize it for the Excel file that you will be
working with.  The default configuration is designed to work with the 
'excelexample.xlsx' file found on the GitHub project
3. Make sure the 'upload_max_filesize' parameter in the 'php.ini' file is set 
to a size large enough to handle your Excel workbook
4. Run the script!
